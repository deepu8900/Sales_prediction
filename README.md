#Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict sales based on various product and outlet features. It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

Overview

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

The model is trained using XGBoost Regressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

Performance is evaluated using metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

After training, the model can be used to predict sales for new data inputs.

Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration

Load dataset using Pandas.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical features.

Normalize/scale numerical data if required.

Model Training

Train the model using XGBRegressor.

Tune hyperparameters for better performance.

Evaluation

Evaluate predictions with R² score and error metrics.

Example: An R² value of 0.9486 means the model explains ~95% of the variance in sales.

Prediction

The trained model is used to predict sales for new input features.

Example Output
R² Score: 0.9486
Predicted Sales: 3100.45
